# sms-spam-detection
The SMS Spam Detection project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. This project implements a classification model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The model is trained on a dataset of SMS messages, where each message is labeled as either spam or ham (not spam).
